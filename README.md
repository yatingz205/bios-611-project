# bios-611-project

## Overview:
This project investigates employment and salary data in the United States by industry and occupation, where
Industry is cagegorized by the **North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)**
and occupation by the **Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System**.

## Instruction:
#### Build Environment
 - Build the image for this project by typing: 
```
docker build . -t pj
```
 - Then start RStudio in your web browser by typing:
```
docker run -e PASSWORD=<some_password> --rm -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/ -p 8787:8787 -t pj
```
 - Once the Rstudio is running connect to it by visiting
https://localhost:8787 in your browser. Log in with username `rstudio` and the password you entered after `PASSWORD=`.

#### Shiny App
 - There are two shiny interactive apps for this project. `shiny_treemap.R` visualizes total employment and mean hourly wage within a selected sector, while `shiny_barplot.R` visualizes the two across states within a selected occupation. To start either one, type:
`shiny::runApp('/home/rstudio/<name of the shiny script>')` in RStudio's terminal to start the shiny app. Then the interactive plot will be shown in a pop-up.
 
#### Generate Results
 - Type `make report.pdf` in the terminal to create the final report.
